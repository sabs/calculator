How to think about the operator/number input

OK, calculator starts at 0

I want it to take, for example:

9 + 15 = 
> and return 24

9 + 15 * 2 / 8
> and return 6

Categories of input:

number (one or more, in sequence, continuing till max or till an operator is input)
operator, for which there are a few responses
so operator means / * - + 

or 
=, return either the result of num1 operator num2
or just return num1 
or repeat the operator/num2 combination on result, which is now num1
